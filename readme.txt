BP My Home makes it possible to add moveable and collapsible widgets to BuddyPress Member's home.

== Description ==

BP My Home requires <a href="http://buddypress.org/">BuddyPress 1.7+</a> and adds to it the ability to add moveable and collapsible custom widgets to Member's home (siteurl/members/name_of_user).
Logged in users can see their Home and choose in their settings area the widgets they want to use. They can also set their Home to be the homepage of the website.

4 widgets comes with this plugin (My Feeds, My Notepad, My Comments, My Bookmarks ). Since version 2.0 of the plugin, you can also add regular WordPress widgets as BP My Home now uses the built in WordPress way of managing widgets.

To set the widgets, the administrator needs to go to the Appearance / Widgets area of his backend to drag and drop the BPMH widgets (or others) into one of the two BPMH available sidebars. In the Settings of the plugin, he can also customize the names and slugs of the plugin.

This plugin is available in French and English.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is BP My Home BuddyPress 1.7 ready ? =

Yes, and it works fine in 1.9 beta 2 !

= Is it possible to add a WordPress sidebar widget ? =

Yes, simply drag it into one of the two BPMH sidebars.

= What are becoming the BPMH widgets i've built for the previous version of BP My Home in version 2.0 ? =

It's important to note that they won't be loaded anymore. All the data they've created in usermetas will still be there, and you can easily transform your old BPMH widget in a new one by using the <a href="https://gist.github.com/imath/5840625">widget skeleton</a> i've put on github.
